Operation of Django Admin
1. User Request:
   When a user enters the Django Admin interface, they make a request through their browser.
2. URLs and Routing:
   Django uses the urls.py file to associate request URLs with specific view functions.
3. View:
   The associated view function handles the logic of the request. In the case of Admin, Django provides predefined         views to handle CRUD operations on models.
4. Model:
   The view logic interacts with Django models to retrieve or modify data in the database.
5. Template:
   The view uses templates to structure and present information appropriately. In the case of Admin, Django provides       default templates that automatically generate forms and tables.
6. User Response:
   Finally, an HTML response is generated and sent to the user's browser, displaying the administration interface with 
   the requested information.
